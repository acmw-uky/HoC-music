This is the code to EasyBuzzer.ino, which demonstrates Arduino code structure and three key functions.
<pre> <code>
  //intialize the pin that is hooked up to the buzzer
  const int buzzerPin = 9;

  //this loop will begin communication
  //between our program and the arduino
  void setup() {
    pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);   //let the program know that buzzerPin (9) is used as OUTPUT
  }

  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  void loop() {
    tone(buzzerPin, 500);     //this function will send a frequency to the buzzerPin and the buzzer will play that note
    delay(100);               //wait a certain amount of time (in milliseconds) before going to the next function
    noTone(buzzerPin);        //this function will stop the sound
    delay(1000);              //wait before looping
  }
</code> </pre>
